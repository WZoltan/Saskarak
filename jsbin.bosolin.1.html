    <h2>Attack</h2>
    <p>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be spearers or smashers<br>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey, and can cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves.</p>
<h3>Eyesight<h3>
    <p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other. They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom. <br>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes it can perceive both polarized light, and colour vision outside the normal visual spectrum. </p>
